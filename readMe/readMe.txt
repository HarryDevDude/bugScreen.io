Game Concept
No time limit or rounds

I want to create a game where the player clicks and/or presses a key on objects that appear randomly on the screen.
*Need to 
  Make grid/flex?
  Check if eventListeners can be combined and if not how to do so.
  Test for space bar key press quarks


Correct user inputs will cause the object to be deleted from the screen with positive feedback and points awarded and then added to running total. Incorrect inputs or if no input within a set time will give a negitive feedback to the player.
*Need to define
  Icons 
    What will they look like
    The duration of their screen time.
  Points
    Where are they placed on the screen
    Look into how to add that to the total
  What are appropriate positive and negitive feedback for a player
    requires testing
  

Objects will appear for a set 'interval(s)'
Objects will be images that represent as icons to quickly allow players to recogize what action(s) needs to be taken.
*Need to
  check line 15-17

Lose state
When player has no life icons
Screen will prompt "Game Over" and reload the game with current high score.
*Need to
  Define how life total is visually is represented
    Icons for life (3 hearts/bars?)
    Placement
    What it looks like when negitive feed is applied

    

Stretch Goals
-Themed objects like bugs for coders to squash
-Objects that appear as only negitive feedback if player preforms action(s) on  them
  This presents more challenges for player
-Accessibility features 
  Due to time constraints, this may not be viable based on required research and testing, iteration and execution.

Due by 8pm
proof of concept
  Research HTML Canvas
  Make grid
    name grid squares with arrays
    make them into quadrants
      name quadrants
  Put image in quadrants
*Tuan helped me get set up with HTML Canvas. It feels nice to be able to choose a path. Was going use the DOM just due to the idea of learning Canvas within the project time constraints.
*Also, starting to notice what a 'rabbit hole' topic is and when it's budding; And how to chooose to engage.

I have choose HTML Canvas. Canvas will be the main body in which my game will be contained



**The scope of the project was much more than I could complete. But I'm still going to work in and try to implement more towards finalization. Lots have changed, I have changed my mind on using HTML Canvas, it's a little bit too much for me to learn right now.
